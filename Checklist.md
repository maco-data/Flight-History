# [x] Why is "csv cols" bugging out!
  - The line above was written as (color = #something) making the parenthesis open.
# [x] Try to add all coordinate data to a series
  - Deleted the for-loop and left the ax.plot(routes['coordinates']).
# [x] The code work but now the lines are not plotted properly -FIX
  - Managed to fix the lines buy putting the lats and lons together in one plot.
# [x] Find how to make lines starter point to be DXB
  - Define the coordinates in lons and lats variables  as list.
  - Plotted the data group dogether by dep/arr lon & dep/arr lat.
# [x] Fix other minor any bugs
  - Set the lines to a width I am happy with
