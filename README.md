# Flight-History
My flight history as a ex-Cabin Crew plotted on a map! 1351 flights narrow down to every unique flight I ever did. 10 years over 9000 hours (DBZ pun not intended)

This project uses a dataset I build up after my flight logbook. I took the unique flights and the coordinates of the Airports and plotted the data on top of the Nasa Black Marbel world map.

I choice to use Cartopy as Matplotlib Basemap suggested to do so (Basemap is bound to be deprecated soon).

This is a small but troublesome project that I have so much fun building up!
